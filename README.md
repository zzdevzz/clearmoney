#### This is the final result of our 2 week Capstone project at Le Wagon.
#### This website allows users to see the impact of their financial choices in real time and allows them to see their money clearly.

#### Excuse if the code has a lot of comments, we were still learning and it helps us remember our thought process.

> - Built a financial dashboard using Turbo in Rails, Stimulus, HTML, SCSS, Javascript.
> - Handled authentication through the devise gem.
> - Integrated Coingecko API to fetch crypto prices.
